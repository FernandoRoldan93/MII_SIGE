# MII_SIGE
## Computer Engineering Master 19-20
Repository for the different projects accomplished during the subject "Sistemas inteligentes para la gestión en la empresa" or Intelligent systems for company management. 

### Activities
[Neural networks in R with caret](./Activities/Exercise_1): This problem consist on implement a solution for the problem of predict the people who survived the titanic disaster using R as language and caret as library. The solution was uploaded to the competion page on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

[Neural networks in R with keras.](./Activities/Exercise_2): This case was the same than the previous one but in this case the library to build the neural networks was keras.

### Practical activities
[Practice 1](./Laboratory_works/Practice_1):	This practice consists on the classification of a transaction in _fraudulent_ or _not fraudulent_ using R. The dataset used is a variation of the __IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection__ competition in kaggle ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/data)).  

[Practice 2](https://github.com/ProyectosComunes-MII/SIGE-P2): In this case the objetive was to elaborate a model for labeling images using __convolutional neural networks__. The images used correspond to the dataset __FASHION-MNIST__ which consist on black and white images from 10 different types of clothes: 
-	T-shirt/top
-	Trouser
-	Pullover
-	Dress
-	Coat
-	Sandal
-	Shirt
-	Sneaker
-	Bag
-	Ankle boot

This practice was implemented with [Lidia Sánchez Mérida](https://github.com/lidiasm)

### Theorical work: Neural Style Transfer
This part of the subject consisted on make an investigation work of one Machine Learning domain and in my case this work was focused on Neural Style Transfer. The code used can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer).
