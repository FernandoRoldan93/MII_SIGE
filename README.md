## Computer Engineering Master 19-20
Repository for the different projects accomplished during the subject "Sistemas inteligentes para la gestión en la empresa" or Intelligent systems for company management. 

### Activities
[Neural networks in R with caret](#): This problem consist on implement a solution for the problem of predict the people who survived the titanic disaster using R as language and caret as library. The solution was uploaded to the competion page on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

[Neural networks in R with keras.](#): This case was the same than the previous one but in this case the library to build the neural networks was keras.

### Practical activities
[Practice 1](#):	This practice consists on the classification of a transaction in _fraudulent_ or _not fraudulent_ using R. The dataset used is a variation of the __IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection__ competition in kaggle ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/data)).  

[Practice 2](https://github.com/ProyectosComunes-MII/SIGE-P2): In this case the objetive was to elaborate a model for labeling images using __convolutional neural networks__. The images used correspond to the dataset __FASHION-MNIST__ which consist on black and white images from 10 different types of clothes: 
-	T-shirt/top
-	Trouser
-	Pullover
-	Dress
-	Coat
-	Sandal
-	Shirt
-	Sneaker
-	Bag
-	Ankle boot

This practice was implemented with [Lidia Sanchez Mérida](https://github.com/lidiasm)
